League of legends important feature extraction and win prediction using various classification models

I plan to use a publicly available dataset of information about matches played in a popular online video game called “League of Legends” to predict, given certain features, whether a team will win. 
This game consists of 10 players separated into two teams fighting against each other. 
They choose certain characters (“champions”) and fight over resources while trying to destroy each other's bases. 
I will find out which features are the most important in this prediction and by how much. 
I would use Decision trees and Logistic regression for the binary classification problem (win or lose). 
Those methods are the ones I feel most comfortable with, so far, but I might implement more if time allows it. 
I am hoping that the end result will show what aspects of the game are most important for the overall win-rate so that players know what they need to focus on. 
I already found a few sites ( for example; “How we trained a machine to predict the winning team in league of legends” ) that did this so I'm not sure how relevant it is but I would still like to do it myself as it seems interesting. 
I also found more than a few useful databases on keggle. 
For example, one that looks at only the first 10 minutes of a game and one that looks at the complete game . 
I would be working on this project alone. 
The code would be written in Python, Jupyter Notebook. 
I also assume that I’ll use skicit-learn and similar Python collections.
